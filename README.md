#### Task:

To spend a week creating a Bingo game console application with C# using Object Oriented Programming principles to demonstrate our ability to pick up new technologies and apply them successfully. 

This task makes use of:

- Visual Studio IDE
- Git Bash
- C#

**How to Download and Use** - click 'clone or download' button, download a zip of our project, unzip, run `./ConsoleApp1.exe 75 5 5 15` in the terminal (make sure to be in `ConsoleApp1\ConsoleApp1\ConsoleApp1\bin\Debug` directory) and enjoy.

#### Summary:

We all found this exercise extremely useful as it gave us an opportunity to learn a new language and applications, become more prepared for the client that we'll be going to, and exercise the knowledge that we had already learnt at Sparta Global. The following list captures most of this:

* Problem solving within programming
* Planning effectively
* Working in a team (locally and remotely) 
* Strongly typed languages like C# and the .NET framework
* Object oriented programming 
* Handling exceptions
* Using/debugging code in Visual Studio, and more.
